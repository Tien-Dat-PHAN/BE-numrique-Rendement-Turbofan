## Note
be2.py is the main program.


## Problem
* Conducted the disadvantages and advantages of Tuborfan and Tuborjet.
* Established a parametric cycle model to evaluate the fundamental rates when working with Tuborfan.

## Solutions

After running the program, there are some conclusions that we can remark on:

* In general, the increase of the dilution rate indices has similar behavior to the global rate.
* The increase in the compression rate trigger equally the thermal rate.

## To improve the performance of LEAP

* Increase the compression rates $\pi_c, \pi_f$.
* Increase the temperature at the end of the combustion chamber $T_{t4}$.
* Increase the dilution rates $\lambda$.
